## SHORT TERM

Misc reminders while in the heat of adapting the adpater.


## LONG TERM

After we get some tests passing

* Check `sql_for_insert` can do without the table regular expresion.
* Do we need the `query_requires_identity_insert` check in `execute`?
* Does the schema cache serialize properly since we conform to that now?
* What does `supports_materialized_views?` means for SQL Server

* Re-visit all `current_adapter?(:PostgreSQLAdapter)` checks and find ones we can play in.


#### Does Find By SQL Work?

With binds and prepareable?

```ruby
#   Post.find_by_sql ["SELECT title FROM posts WHERE author = ? AND created > ?", author_id, start_date]
#   Post.find_by_sql ["SELECT body FROM comments WHERE author = :user_id OR approved_by = :user_id", { :user_id => user_id }]
#
def find_by_sql(sql, binds = [], preparable: nil)
  result_set = connection.select_all(sanitize_sql(sql), "#{name} Load", binds, preparable: preparable)
```
